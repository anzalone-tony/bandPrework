            <h2>How I heard Car Seat Headrest...</h2>

            <p> So.. I heard Car Seat Headrest on an airplane while watching the Netflix show 'Flaked' starring Will
                Arnett.
                There was a scene where he will is walking aimlessly through Venice. He flaked on a date with one of his
                peers from
                AA. I think the lyric that caught my attention on that plane ride was "I want to kick my head in the
                shins".
                That was it.
                It was mindblowing for some reason. I would rewind the show to the beginning of the song and listen to
                it on
                repeat until
                the plane landed and I could take my phone out of airplane mode. I quickly googled the lyric from before
                and
                saw the band
                name Car Seat Headrest. I thought it was a terrible name and felt this would end up anticlimactic. I
                downloaded the album
                Teens of style and listened to the song a few more times. It was still just as good as the first time it
                played. There is
                a lot more to the story but I'm going to cut it a bit short. I loved them and still do. Below are videos
                to
                the songs I
                really enjoy. Hope you enjoy them too!
